    <h1>Welcome to My Sample Page</h1>

    <p>This is the first sample paragraph. It contains some basic text to demonstrate how a paragraph looks in HTML. You can use paragraphs to divide your text into manageable sections.</p>

    <p>Here is the second sample paragraph. You can add as many paragraphs as you like, and each one will be separated by a small amount of space. This makes reading the content easier and more organized.</p>

    <p>Finally, this is the third paragraph. You can also style paragraphs using CSS, making the text bold, italic, or changing the font size.</p>
